This package is the official portable version of LibreSSL
	(http://www.libressl.org).

LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL developed by the OpenBSD project
(http://www.openbsd.org). LibreSSL is developed on OpenBSD. This
package then adds portability shims for other operating systems.

Official release tarballs are available at your friendly neighborhood
OpenBSD mirror in directory LibreSSL, e.g.:

	http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/

although we suggest that you use a mirror:

	http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

The LibreSSL portable build framework is also mirrored in Github:

	https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable

Please report bugs either to tech@openbsd.org, or to the github issue tracker:

If you have checked this source using Git, follow these initial steps to
prepare the source tree for building:

 1. ensure you have the following packages installed:
	automake, autoconf, bash, git, libtool, perl, pod2man
 2. run './autogen.sh' to prepare the source tree for building
    or run './dist.sh' to prepare a tarball.

Once you have a source tree from Git or FTP, run these commands to build and
install the package:

  ./configure   # see ./configure --help for configuration options
  make check    # runs builtin unit tests
  make install  # set DESTDIR= to install to an alternate location

The resulting library and 'openssl' utility is largely API-compatible with
OpenSSL 1.0.1. However, it is not ABI compatible - you will need to relink your
programs to LibreSSL in order to use it, just as in moving from OpenSSL 0.9.8
to 1.0.1.

The project attempts to provide working alternatives for operating systems with
limited or broken security primitives (e.g. arc4random(3), issetugid(2)) and
assists with improving OS-native implementations where possible.

LibreSSL portable will build on any reasonably modern version of Linux,
Solaris, or OSX with a standards-compliant compiler and C library.
